This project allows you to run a terminal-based contact card using `npx`. <br> To display the card, simply hit the terminal and run this command with `npm` pre-installed:

```bash

npx irtesaam

# It will ask "yes" or "no" to download the package. Enter "y".

```
The npx card offers multiple ways to connect with me including Gmail, LinkedIn, GitHub and an easy access to my portfolio and resume.
Check it out and share your thoughts on what else could be added and report any bugs in the Github issue tab (if you find any) with proper documentation !

<b>In the future, I plan to introduce a feature that lets you create your own npx card with a similar design by simply answering a few prompts, and your personalized card will be ready in no time!</b>
